                            <span class="card-title" ><b>HEADSTOCK</b></span>
                            <p>The Headstock is at the top of the guitar and is sometimes refered to as the bass guitar machine head. This is where the Tuning keys (pegs) are housed, which you tighten or loosen to adjust the tone of the strings. Many bass guitars have a distinctive straight neck and no head, which separates them from traditional guitars. These “headless” bass guitars have Tuning Pegs on the neck instead. </p>
                            <br></br>
                            <span class="card-title"><b>NUT</b></span>
                            <p>The nut is the place where strings contact the guitar in between the guitar neck and headstock. You will see a rectangular block which is the nut. Evenly spaced grooves will hold the strings into place. Although small, the nut can make a different to the sound of the guitar.</p>
                            <br></br>
                            <span class="card-title"><b>THE BASS GUITAR NECK</b></span>
                            <p>The neck connects the Headstock to the body of the guitar. There are two types of neck; the traditional “Bolt On” neck which is, as the name implies, bolted to the guitar body (Most Fender basses and guitars use this construction) and the “Neck-Through” which is made from several layers of wood lamenated together.</p>
                            <br></br>
                            <span class="card-title"><b>TUNING PEGS</b></span>
                            <p>The Tuning Pegs are on the Headstock and control the sound you will hear from the strings. You can adjust the tension to make the strings tighter or looser. Most pegs use a “worm gear” which tightens the string by wrapping it around the screw. Depending on your headstock you may have 4 pegs on one side or 2 on each. ​</p>
                            <br></br>
                            <span class="card-title"><b>BASS FRETBOARD, FRETS, and INLAYS</b></span>
                            <p>The Fretboard is a piece of wood that lays on the face of the neck. Mounted on the fretboard are small metal blocks evenly spaced along the length of the neck. The metal blocks are called Frets and divide the neck into areas of different notes.
                               There are also little markers along the Fretboard called inlays. Sometimes called neck plates, these function as a quick reference where you are on the guitar. Most guitars will have between 20 and 24 Frets, although you can find guitars which have up to 32 Frets and are often used by soloists who need to play a wider range of notes. Fretless basses are also available and have a different more muffled sound, but are popular in Jazz.</p>
                            <br></br>
                            <span class="card-title"><b>BASS GUITAR BODY</b></span>
                            <p>The Body of the guitar is the biggest and most distinct area. However, the only function is to provide a mounting point for the other parts of the guitar attach to. You will find all of the guitars electronics here, including the pickup mounting, switch knobs, control knobs and volume pots, tremolo bars, and input and output jacks. You’ll also find structural components like the bass bridges, strap button, and pickguard
                               Alder and Maple are popular woods to make a guitar body out of. Newer bass guitars have been made from synthetic materials such as Luthite. </p>
                            <br></br>
                            <span class="card-title"><b>PICKUPS</b></span>
                            <p>The Pickups are mounted on the body under the strings. Most pickups are rectangular blocks with metal circles on. These metal circles are magnetic and help convert the vibration of the strings into electric voltages that can then be converted into sound via an amplifier.</p>
                            <br></br>
                            <span class="card-title"><b>TRUSS ROD</b></span>
                            <p>The Truss Rod protects the guitar from bending out of the shape. Due to the tension of the strings and pressure the guitar can often bend at the neck. The Truss Rod usually spans the length of the neck and neutralises the pressure from the strings.
                              You can use a specific tool to adjust the Truss Rod, in order to repair any bowing in the neck, but shouldn’t attempt to adjust the Truss Rod to change the sound of the guitar. Most bass guitar parts guides skip this piece, but it’s important enough to be added!</p>
                            <br></br>
                            <span class="card-title"><b>BRIDGE</b></span>
                            <p>Bass guitar bridges sit near the base of the guitar body and is where the strings are anchored into the body. The base unit is usually metal with the strings attached securely to it. A saddle holds the strings in place, with a small groove for the string to pass through.
                                You can make adjustments to the strings at the bottom using the saddle height adjustments. However, generally the novice will use the tuning pegs rather than adjusting the saddle. Heavier metals such as brass are often used to hold the strings in place.</p>
                            <br></br>
                            <span class="card-title"><b>PICK GUARD</b></span>
                            <p>The Pick Guard is the protective cover that covers the body of the guitar to prevent damage from repeated use with a pick. It can be made of a variety of synthetic materials, metal or wood.</p>

                            <p>No guide on bass guitar parts would be complete without the strings. You’d think the strings are fairly self-explanatory, but there are a lot of them. Check out our complete guide to bass guitar strings</p>
